<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>These simple steps will help you use the FajitaBoy correctly.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Obtain a ROM</h3>

<p>The first thing you'll need to do in order to use FajitaBoy is to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=game%20boy%20rom">obtain a game</a> you wish to play, like <a href="http://www.doperoms.co.uk/files/roms/gameboy_and_gbc/Tetris+DX+%28JU%29+%5BC%5D%5B%21%5D.zip/54993/Tetris+DX+.zip">Tetris</a> for example. FajitaBoy can play most Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. Save the ROM file to your harddrive and remember where you put it.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Loading the FajitaBoy applet</h3>

<p>FajitaBoy is a signed Java applet. When loading the applet you will therefore get a popup asking for your trust in the unknown. Depending on your operating system, it might look something like this </p>

<p>Unfortunately, you'll need to accept this certificate in order to use FajitaBoy. If you didn't accept, and change your mind, you might need to restart your browser to get another chance.</p>

<p>Why does FajitaBoy need a certificate? Java applets are not allowed to read files from the users harddrive by default. FajitaBoy however needs to read the ROM files provided by the user in order to play games. The certificate allows FajitaBoy to read local files. If you are afraid we intend to abuse this right, feel free to check out our <a href="http://my-trac.assembla.com/fajita/browser/TRUNK/src/fajitaboy">source code</a>.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Using the FajitaBoy applet</h3>

<p>To start a singleplayer game, click the singleplayer button. </p>

<p>Next up you need to load the ROM file from your local harddrive. FajitaBoy accepts .gb, .gbc and .zip files. You can do this either by manually entering the path into the textfield... </p>

<p>by browsing for it.</p>

<p>When you have selected a file, click the Start Game button to continue.</p>

<p>The emulator will now initiate, and you can start playing the game. </p>
<p><img src="image/instructions_5.png" /> </p>
<p>By default you use the arrow keys for joypad controls, 'x' and 'z' for A and B buttons and Enter och Shift for Start and Select buttons. These settings can be changed, as you will see a few steps down.</p>

<p>Other useful keys are 'p' to toggle Pause, 'm' to toggle Mute and Esc to bring up or close the ingame menu.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Using the ingame menu</h3>
<p>The ingame menu is divided into three tabs - Game, Keys, Sound.</p>
<p>In the game tab FajitaBoy provides the possibility to save states, ie saving the game. You can later on load the state to resume the game as it was when you saved. You can also reset the current ROM or go back to the main menu and load a new one using this menu.</p>

<p>The Keys tab allows you to change your keybindings. To change a key use the mouse to click a button and then click a new key. The Reset button sets all keys to the default bindings.</p>

<p>If you have cookies enabled you can save your keybindings. These will then be loaded automatically the next time you use FajitaBoy.</p>

<p>In the Sound tab you can change the volume of the emulator. Setting it to zero will disable the audio which can give a slight boost to performance. </p>
