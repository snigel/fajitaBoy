<p>Next up you need to load a Game Boy or Game Boy Color <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=game%20boy%20rom">ROM file</a> from your local harddrive. You can do this either by manually entering the path into the textfield... </p>

<p>by browsing for it.</p>

<p>When you have selected a file, click the Start Game button to continue.</p>

<p>The emulator will now initiate, and you can start playing the game. </p>

<p>By default you use the arrow keys for joypad controls, 'x' and 'z' for A and B buttons and Enter och Shift for Start and Select buttons. These settings can be changed, as you will see a few steps down.</p>

<p>Other useful keys are 'p' for Pause, 'm' for Mute and Esc to bring up the ingame menu.</p>
<p>The ingame menu is divided into three tabs - Game, Keys, Sound. Pressing esc again closes the menu.</p>
<p>In the game tab FajitaBoy provides the possibility to save states, ie saving the game. You can later on load the state to resume the game as it was when you saved. You can also reset the current ROM or go back to the main menu and load a new one using this menu.</p>

<p>The Keys tab allows you to change your keybindings. To change a key use the mouse to click a button and then click a new key. The Reset button sets all keys to the default bindings.</p>

<p>If you have cookies enabled you can save your keybindings. These will then be loaded automatically the next time you use FajitaBoy.</p>

<p>In the Sound tab you can change the volume of the emulator. Setting it to zero will disable the audio which can give a slight boost to performance. </p>
